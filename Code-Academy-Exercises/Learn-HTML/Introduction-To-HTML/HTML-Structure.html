<!--when an element is nested within another element the nested element becomes the child of the element within which is nested (the parent)
  this structure is called the HTML hierarchy, the child elements inherit the style and behavior of their prent elements-->
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>
